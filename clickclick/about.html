<p>Human Knowledge
<br>BY ROBERT WRIGLEY
<br>
<br>
About the only thing I thought I knew<br>
was that nothing I'd ever know would do<br>
any good. Sunrise, say, or that the part<br>
of the horse's hoof that most resembles<br>
a human palm is called the frog;<br>
certain chords on the guitar of no mercantile use;<br>
the abstruse circuitry of an envelope<br>
quatrain; even the meaning of horripilation.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes on a flatland mound the ancients had made,<br>
I took heart in the pointlessness of stars<br>
and lay there until my teeth chattered.<br>
I earned my last Boy Scout merit badge<br>
building a birdhouse out of license plates<br>
manufactured by felons in the big house.<br>
No more paramilitary organizations for me,<br>
I said, ten years before I was drafted.<br>
<br>
I had skills. Sure-footedness and slick<br>
fielding. Eventually I would learn to unhook<br>
a bra one-handed, practicing on my friend,<br>
his sister's worn over his T-shirt (I took<br>
my turns too). One Easter Sunday I hid<br>
through the church service among the pipes<br>
of the organ and still did not have faith,<br>
although my ears rang until Monday.<br>
<br>
I began to know that little worth knowing<br>
was knowable and faith was delusion.<br>
I began to believe I believed in believing<br>
nothing I was supposed to believe in,<br>
except the stars, which, like me,<br>
were not significant, except for their light,<br>
meaning I loved them for their pointlessness.<br>
I believed I owned them somehow.<br>
<br>
A C major 7th chord was beautiful and almost rare.<br>
The horse I loved foundered and had to be<br>
put down. The middle rhyme in an envelope<br>
quatrain was not imprisoned if it was right.<br>
In cold air a nipple horripilates<br>
and rises, the sun comes up and up and up,<br>
a star that bakes the eggs<br>
in a Boy Scout license plate birdhouse.<br>
<br>
God was in music and music was God.<br>
A drill sergeant seized me by my dog tag<br>
chain and threatened to beat me<br>
to a pile of bloody guts for the peace sign<br>
I'd chiseled in the first of my two tags,<br>
the one he said theyâ€™d leave in my mouth<br>
before they zipped the body bag closed.<br>
Yet one more thing I'd come to know.<br>
<br>
He also said that Uncle Sam owned my ass,<br>
no more true than my ownership<br>
of the stars. I can play a C major 7th chord<br>
in five or six places on the neck of a guitar.<br>
A stabled horse's frog degrades; a wild horse's<br>
becomes a callus, smooth as leather.<br>
Stars are invisible in rainy weather,<br>
something any fool knows, of course.</p>
